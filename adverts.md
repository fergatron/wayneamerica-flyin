I finally dropped the **WayneAmerica Fly In** scenery add-on for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. I made some tweaks to the airport (Wayne Municipal, LCG), added some animated humans, and other scenery elements.

This scenery was a blast. I learned a lot and even started doing some #blender work. Always looking for feedback on how I can make the add-on better.
