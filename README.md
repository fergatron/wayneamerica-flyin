This scenery project is to simulate (with some creative freedom) the WayneAmerica Fly In event that's hosted at Wayne Municipal Airport (LCG) in Nebraska each year. At the airport is also a National STOL Competition; a thrilling aviation event that attracts pilots from across the country to showcase their Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) skills. Against the backdrop of Wayne's picturesque scenery, competitors engage in high-stakes contests, demonstrating their precision and expertise in navigating the challenging course.
